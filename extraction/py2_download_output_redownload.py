"""This script is used to fix a file we want to use as input of "persist.py", when it has a particular encoding problem.
The problem seems to be related with a difference between how different Python versions handle string literals.
First, note that the input file is not a real json, but a list of Python dicts printed (i.e., `print(dict)` vs
`print(json.dumps(dict))`). So, there are string literals. The file may be in UTF-8, but the thing is that the string
literals may contain Unicode-escaped symbols (e.g., `\\xNN`, `\\uNN` or `\\UNNNN`), which represent bytes in different
encodings. In the default compiled version of CPython 3.6 in Linux, it represents them internally in UTF-8, but
in Python 2.7 apparently it does so UTF-16, or at least that's my understanding (see
https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html#the-unicode-type). So Unicode-escaped symbols change.
I don't find an easy way to fix it, more than re-downloading the tweets, which is fairly fast."""
